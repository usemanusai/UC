## Critical Learnings

- **Integration Gap Discovered**: The project uses an SQLite database `discovery_results.db` and `checked_accounts.db` to store history and results, but there is no built-in way to export this data into a more universally readable format like CSV.
- **Proposed Feature**: SQLite Log-to-CSV Report Generator. This completes the workflow (as mentioned in Voyager's favorite features) and provides a highly requested way to review validation results offline or in Excel/Google Sheets.
